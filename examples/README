Working example of a reverse proxy configuration.

On the serverside a webserver on port 8000 is opened. Every request
is sent to the VPN server, via the VPN and from the VPN client to
a separate docker container (running example application whoami)
there.

Add keys, set endpoint, run. Then you can on the server side docker

    wget -q -O- http://localhost:8000/

and you will get the response from the "whoami" server.
